## Data set
We employ the data obtained from:
1. MDC1: Mock data challenge dataset 1
2. MDC2: Mock data challenge dataset 2

## Purpose
We conduct basic level data analysis and curve fits:
1. Linear least squares fitting
2. Maximum likelihood fitting

## Steps
We will perform the tasks with the following steps:
1. Load MDC dataset
